# Healthcheck

I got annoyed that I had to carry Ruby on my back just to get simple cpu, memory and disk checks for Consul nodes, so I wrote this tiny utility to fill in this particular gap.

This is also the first Go program I've ever written so cut me some slack :P

## Installation

Download a binary from the release section.
